Thank you for the opportunity.

Please see https://github.com/Dilip-Vaghela/EnsekApi/tree/master/Resource containing all documents relating to testing of the site.

The rest of the reposity will contain automated work relating to the APIs.

As a bonus I will be creating selenium framework to showcase my automation skills. Sadly I was not able to get it done in time, but will get it done as soon as possible and send it over.

Thank you

Dilip Vaghela
